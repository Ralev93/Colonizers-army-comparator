A simple colonizers army comparator, with which one can find answer to the questions:

3. Which troops do I need as reinforcement?
4. Do I really need level 6 for troop X in reinforcement?

#####_Disclaimer_
Although some troops might have bigger damage per second versus others, the later may be much better choice.
_For example_: 15 6* Levithians have **73.52%** more dmg/s versus 3 widows 6\*, but still the **widows are much more better**.

Note also, that the application doesn't consider the additional levithians after widow's death...for now.
